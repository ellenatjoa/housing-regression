# Linear Regression on Boston Housing Dataset
For this project, we have a Boston housing dataset that contains 506 samples and 13 feature variables. The categories in the dataset, include:

- CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town
- ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft
- INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- NOX: Nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million)
- RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
- RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways
- TAX: Full-value property tax rate per ten thousand dollars
- PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
- B: 1000(Bk — 0.63)², where Bk is the proportion of people of African American descent by town
- LSTAT: Percentage of lower status of the population
- MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in thousand dollars
The goal of this project is to create a Linear Regression model to predict the price of each houses based on the given features.
